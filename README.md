# 4D-Fractal
A program that takes cross sections of a fractal defined by a recursive function over ‚Ñù4 . The cross section formed is both a function of space and time, allowing for a highly chaotic yet beautiful visualization.

## Files
fractal.py - All the logic for computation of the fractal

image.py - The main file to run and that which colors and creates the images from the fractal

presets.py - The preset file. Alternative presets are in presets folder

quadmap.py - Maps a rectangle from 2D to 4D space

fractal.mov - The outputed video


## Folders
presets - A collection of cool presets we found

data - All the images that the program creates
